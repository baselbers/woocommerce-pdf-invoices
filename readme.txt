Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking Install Now. After clicking that link you will be asked if you're sure you want to install the plugin. Click yes and WordPress will automatically complete the installation.

#### Manual installation
The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application.

1. Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it
2. Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation's wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

#### How to add your custom template?
To getting started, copy the default template files (including folder) called `plugins/woocommerce-pdf-invoices/includes/templates/invoices/simple/micro` to `uploads/bewpi-templates/invoices/simple` and rename the template folder `micro`. The plugin will now detect the template and makes it available for selection within the template settings tab. Now go ahead en start making some changes to the template files! :)

#### How to add a fee to the invoice?
To add a fee to WooCommerce and your invoice, simply add the following action to your themes `functions.php`.

`
function add_woocommerce_fee() {
    global $woocommerce;

    if ( is_admin() && ! defined( 'DOING_AJAX' ) )
        return;

    $amount = 5;
    $woocommerce->cart->add_fee( 'FEE_NAME', $amount, true, 'standard' );
}
add_action( 'woocommerce_cart_calculate_fees','add_woocommerce_fee' );
`

#### How to hide order item meta?
To hide order item meta from the invoice, simply add the following filter to your themes `functions.php`.

`
/**
 * Hide order itemmeta on WooCommerce PDF Invoices' invoice template.
 *
 * @param array $hidden_order_itemmeta itemmeta.
 *
 * @return array
 */
function bewpi_alter_hidden_order_itemmeta( $hidden_order_itemmeta ) {
	$hidden_order_itemmeta[] = '_wc_cog_item_cost';
	$hidden_order_itemmeta[] = '_wc_cog_item_total_cost';
	$hidden_order_itemmeta[] = '_subscription_interval';
    $hidden_order_itemmeta[] = '_subscription_length';
	// end so on..
	return $hidden_order_itemmeta;
}
add_filter( 'bewpi_hidden_order_itemmeta', 'bewpi_alter_hidden_order_itemmeta', 10, 1 );
`

#### How to change the common PDF options?
To change the more common options of the PDF, use below example.

`
function custom_bewpi_mpdf_options( $options ) {
 	$options['mode'] = '';
 	$options['format'] = ''; // use [format]-L or [format]-P to force orientation (A4-L will be size A4 with landscape orientation)
 	$options['default_font_size'] = 0;
 	$options['default_font'] = 'opensans';
 	$options['margin_left'] = 14;
 	$options['margin_right'] = 14;
 	$options['margin_top'] = 14;
 	$options['margin_bottom'] = 0;
 	$options['margin_header'] = 14;
 	$options['margin_footer'] = 6;
 	$options['orientation'] = 'P'; // Also try to force with format option

 	return $options;
}
add_filter( 'bewpi_mpdf_options', 'custom_bewpi_mpdf_options' );
`

#### How to change the more advanced PDF options?
To fully customize the PDF, use below code. This filter gives you full control over the mPDF library. Check the mPDF [manual](https://www.dropbox.com/s/h44f7v5anvcmmvl/mpdfmanual.pdf?dl=0) for more info.

`
function bewpi_mpdf( $mpdf ) {
    // change the direction of the invoice to RTL
    $mpdf->SetDirectionality( 'rtl' );

    return $mpdf;
}
add_filter( 'bewpi_mpdf', 'bewpi_mpdf' );
`

#### How to display invoice download button on specific template files?
Add below code for example to your "thankyou" page or "customer-completed-order" email template.

`
echo do_shortcode( '[bewpi-download-invoice title="Download (PDF) Invoice {formatted_invoice_number}" order_id="' . $order->id . '"]' );
`

For use in WordPress editor use below shortcode. This will only work if you replace "{ORDER_ID}" with an actual order id.

`
[bewpi-download-invoice title="Download (PDF) Invoice {formatted_invoice_number}" order_id="{ORDER_ID}"]
`

Note: Download button will only be displayed when PDF exists and order has been paid.

#### Logo image shows a red cross?
By default the relative path is used for better performance, try to base64 the image. Also read the sticky topic on the support forum for more solutions!

`
function convert_company_logo_to_base64( $company_logo_path ) {
    $company_logo_url = str_replace( '..', get_site_url(), $company_logo_path );
    $type = pathinfo( $company_logo_url, PATHINFO_EXTENSION );
    $data = wp_remote_fopen( $company_logo_url );
    $base64 = 'data:image/' . $type . ';base64,' . base64_encode( $data );
    return $base64;
}
add_filter( 'bewpi_company_logo_url', 'convert_company_logo_to_base64' );
`

#### How to skip invoice generation based on specific payment methods?
Add the name of the payment method to the array.

`
function bewpi_attach_invoice_excluded_payment_methods( $payment_methods ) {
    return array( 'bacs', 'cod', 'cheque', 'paypal' );
}
add_filter( 'bewpi_attach_invoice_excluded_payment_methods', 'bewpi_attach_invoice_excluded_payment_methods', 10, 2 );
`

#### How to allow specific roles to download invoice?
Add the name of the role to the array. By default shop managers and administrators are allowed to download invoices.

`
function bewpi_allowed_roles_to_download_invoice($allowed_roles) {
    // available roles: shop_manager, customer, contributor, author, editor, administrator
    $allowed_roles[] = "editor";
    // end so on..
    return $allowed_roles;
}
add_filter( 'bewpi_allowed_roles_to_download_invoice', 'bewpi_allowed_roles_to_download_invoice', 10, 2 );
`

### How to alter formatted invoice number? ###
Add following filter function to your functions.php within your theme.

`
function alter_formatted_invoice_number( $formatted_invoice_number, $invoice_type ) {
   if ( $invoice_type === 'global' ) { // simple or global.
      // add M for global invoices.
      return 'M' . $formatted_invoice_number;
   }
   return $formatted_invoice_number;
}
add_filter( 'bewpi_formatted_invoice_number', 'alter_formatted_invoice_number', 10, 2 );
`
